## 📦 Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohannad20/Vecotradiv.git
cd vecotradiv
```
2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```
3. **Start the development servers**:
```bash
npm run dev:all
```
This runs both the Vite dev server and two json-server instances:

JSON server for services at http://localhost:3001

JSON server for jobs at http://localhost:3002

## 🌐 Internationalization
The app supports French and English through JSON files located in src/i18n/locales/. To add a new language:

Create a new directory for your language code (e.g., fr for French)

Add a translation.json file with the same structure:

json
{
  "welcome": "Welcome to Vecotradiv",
  "services": "Services",
  "jobs": "Jobs"
  // Add all other translation keys here
}
Register the new language in the i18n configuration
